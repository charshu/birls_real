If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n     * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n     *\n     * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n     * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n     * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n     *\n     * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n     * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n     * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n     * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n     *\n     * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * \\@stable\n     */\n    var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} _renderer\n         * @param {?} _elementRef\n         */\n        function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n            this._renderer = _renderer;\n            this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n            /** @internal */\n            this._optionMap = new Map();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._idCounter = 0;\n            this.onChange = function (_) { };\n            this.onTouched = function () { };\n        }\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n            this.value = value;\n            var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n            if (id == null) {\n                this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n            }\n            var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n            var _this = this;\n            this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n                _this.value = valueString;\n                fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n            };\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

You can also\n     * listen to its {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n     * status is re-calculated.\n     *\n     * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {\\@link FormArray} dynamically by\n     * calling its {\\@link FormArray.push} method.\n     *  Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * {\\@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n     *\n     * \\@stable\n     */\n    var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$12(FormArrayName, _super);\n        /**\n         * @param {?} parent\n         * @param {?} validators\n         * @param {?} asyncValidators\n         */\n        function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._validators = validators;\n            this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n            this._checkParentType();\n            this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n            if (this.formDirective) {\n                this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n            }\n        };\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /** Color of the icon. */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"md-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
